## Spring Boot v3.5.5
## Java 17

### A database wasn't a requirement, so I've used a list as the repository data

## Requirements:

Create an API that acts as a store management tool

- Create a Github profile if you don't have one (✓)

- Use git in a verbose manner, push even if you wrote only one class (✓)

- Create a Java, maven based project, Spring Boot for the web part (✓)

- No front-end, you can focus on backend structure (✓)

- Implement some functions, for example: add-product, find-product, change-price or others (✓)

- Implement a basic authentication mechanism and role based endpoint access (✓) -> *the users and passwords should usually be hidden but this is just for demo purposes*

- Design error mechanism and handling plus logging (✓)

- Write unit tests, at least for one class (✓) -> *done with AI*

- Nice to have: use Java 17+ features (✓)

- Add a small Readme to document the project (✓)
